# CGI-Clipboard-Sharing

This is not an open source project. This repo is only available as a backup for myself. However, you are free to make any modifications and use it in anyway if you wish.

To do: Actual intention was to create a daemon which monitors the clipboard and syncs with an android device over the LAN. Due to limited free time and busy schedules, I had to give up the idea and end up with a simple solution. Need to implement the planned solution.

1. Ubuntu (I have not tried it in any other platform).
2. Python 2.7
3. xclip

```apt install xclip```

4. Bash (or shell)
5. Execute permission on clip.sh file.
